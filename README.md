Tesla Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning LSTM

Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices of Tesla (TSLA) by utilizing machine learning techniques on historical market data,
along with other external factors such as economic trends and media sentiments. This project aims to understand price behavior patterns and provide forecasts
based on these patterns.

Key Steps of the Project:
Data Collection:

Sources: Collect historical stock price data for Tesla from platforms like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or stock market APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud).
Data Types:
Stock market data: Open, Close, High, Low, Volume.
Economic indicators: Interest rates, inflation rates, etc.
Sentiment analysis data: News articles, social media sentiment related to Tesla.
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and format the data appropriately.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that may improve model performance, such as moving averages, volatility indicators, and sentiment scores.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the historical stock price trends and patterns.
Visualize relationships between Tesla stock prices and the selected features (economic indicators, sentiment analysis).
Model Selection:

Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series prediction
Select the most suitable models based on performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, R-squared).
Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the models on the training set and evaluate their performance on the testing set.
Use cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to make predictions on future stock prices.
Visualize the predicted prices against actual prices for comparison.
Deployment:

Develop a web application or dashboard to present predictions and visualizations.
Integrate a real-time data feed to update predictions as new data becomes available.
Documentation and Reporting:

Document the entire process, including challenges faced and lessons learned.
Prepare a report detailing findings, model performance, and potential improvements.
Expected Outcomes:
A functional model that accurately predicts Tesla's stock prices.
Insights into the factors influencing stock price changes.
A user-friendly interface for stakeholders to interact with the model's predictions.
Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning)
Data Sources: Yahoo Finance API, news sentiment analysis APIs
